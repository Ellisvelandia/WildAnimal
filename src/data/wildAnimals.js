      "Few animals have captured the imagination like brown bears. They can stand on two legs, walk on the soles of their feet, pick things up with their “fingers,” and often eat what we eat. This—coupled with their ability to communicate with one another through scratch marks left on trees, smells and sounds—establishes a similarity to our own way of life. Some of the largest living carnivores, brown bears have fallen prey to hunting and other conflicts with humans.",

      "But not everyone appreciates their bright-eyed, bushy-tailed charms. The abundance of squirrels in rural, urban and suburban neighborhoods can cause people to view them as a nuisance and disregard their special role in ecosystems. Every year, countless squirrels are killed simply for doing what's natural: looking for a meal and finding a safe shelter. There are many great solutions when dealing with squirrels. ",
